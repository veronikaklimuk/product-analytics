üçè [Grocery Delivery App Analysis](https://github.com/veronikaklimuk/product-analytics/blob/main/grocery_delivery_app_analysis.ipynb)

In this notebook I analyse user behaviour and evaluate the effectiveness of acquisition channels.

The main¬†**objective**¬†is to answer the following questions:
1. What is the number of monthly active users (MAU) in February?
2. What is the number of installs in January?
3. Which daily cohort has the largest CR?
4. Which paid acquisition channel is the most effective?
5. At what step does the most number of registered users fall off?
6. Which acquisition channel has the lowest CR from first app start to first purchase?
7. Which acquisition channel has users with the largest median first check?
8. Which acquisition channel has the largest ROMI? (only the first purchases are taken into account)
